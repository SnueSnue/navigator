# Navigator :))

// This project is still under construction

Hello, I use these programs two navigate my school folders, since
their names are not very intuitive.

I've deployed them by adding the following to the bottom of my zshrc :))

alias sdu='source /path/to/navigator.sh /path/to/overview'

where overview is the file with the overview over your folder.
navigator.sh expects the overview to be in the same folder, as the folders it is describing.

Currently, im calling the C-program from the shell-script. If you have any idea about,
how to combine the two into one program (in either shell-script or c), please let me know :))
